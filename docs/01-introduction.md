# 1. Introduction

## Project Vision

The PLC Code-First Editor aims to revolutionize PLC programming by providing a modern, web-based development environment centered around a code-first workflow. Traditional PLC development often relies on proprietary, desktop-based software with graphical interfaces. This project seeks to offer an alternative that leverages the benefits of modern web technologies and text-based coding practices.

## Goals

*   **Code-First Approach:** Prioritize writing PLC logic using structured text (IEC 61131-3 ST standard, potentially with extensions) in a familiar code editor environment.
*   **Web-Based Accessibility:** Provide a platform-independent editor accessible through any modern web browser.
*   **Modern Developer Experience:** Incorporate features common in modern IDEs, such as syntax highlighting, code parsing, error checking, auto-completion (future goal), and version control integration (future goal).
*   **Interoperability:**
    *   Enable exporting projects in the standard PLCopen XML format for compatibility with existing PLC engineering tools.
    *   Explore potential future integration with PLC runtime APIs (e.g., Codesys) for direct deployment and debugging.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitate team collaboration through cloud-based storage and potential real-time features (future goal).
*   **Extensibility:** Design the architecture to allow for future expansion, potentially supporting other PLC languages (LD, FBD) or integrations.

## Target Audience

*   PLC programmers looking for a more flexible, text-based development environment.
*   Software developers transitioning to PLC programming.
*   Educational institutions teaching PLC programming concepts.
*   Teams seeking collaborative PLC development tools.

This project is currently in its early stages (Beta) but demonstrates the core editing, parsing, and export functionalities.
