# 6. PLCopen XML Export

The PLC Code-First Editor provides functionality to export the defined Function Block structures into the PLCopen XML format (specifically targeting the TC6_0201 schema version). This allows for potential interoperability with other PLC development environments that support this standard.

## How it Works

1.  **Parsing:** The editor uses the custom parser (`src/utils/plcParser.ts`) to analyze the Structured Text code and create an internal representation (`ParserResult`) of the Function Blocks, including their variables, methods, and properties.
2.  **Generation:** The `generatePLCopenXML` function takes this `ParserResult` and constructs an XML string.
3.  **Mapping:**
    *   Each `FUNCTION_BLOCK` in the ST code is mapped to a `<pou>` element with `pouType="functionBlock"` in the XML.
    *   Variables declared in `VAR_INPUT`, `VAR_OUTPUT`, `VAR_IN_OUT`, and `VAR` sections are mapped to corresponding `<inputVars>`, `<outputVars>`, `<inOutVars>`, and `<localVars>` sections within the POU's `<interface>`.
    *   Variable names, data types, initial values, and comments (if present) are included for each variable.
4.  **Implementation Body:** The `<ST>` (Structured Text) section within the POU's `<body>` is used to represent the implementation.
    *   **Current Limitation:** The actual implementation logic from methods and properties is currently included as plain text wrapped in `<p>` tags within an `<xhtml>` block. This is **not** a standard or fully functional representation of ST logic within PLCopen XML. It serves more as a textual placeholder. A compliant export would typically require a more structured representation of the ST code itself within the `<ST>` tags, often preserving formatting and potentially using CDATA sections.

## How to Use

1.  Write or load your Function Block code in the editor.
2.  Ensure the code parses without critical structural errors (check the error list).
3.  Click the "Export XML" button (or similar) in the editor's toolbar or menu.
4.  The application will generate the XML file based on the parsed code.
5.  Your browser will prompt you to download the generated `.xml` file. The filename will typically be based on the title you've given the code snippet (e.g., `MyFunctionBlock.xml`).

## Limitations and Considerations

*   **Implementation Representation:** As mentioned, the implementation logic is not exported in a standard, machine-readable format within the XML body. Importing this XML into another tool might only bring in the POU interface (variables) correctly, while the implementation might appear as simple text or be ignored.
*   **Parser Limitations:** The accuracy and completeness of the XML export depend directly on the capabilities of the ST parser. Any ST constructs not understood by the parser (see [PLC Language Support](./05-plc-language.md)) will not be included or correctly represented in the XML.
*   **No Other POU Types:** Only `FUNCTION_BLOCK` POUs are currently exported. `PROGRAM` or `FUNCTION` POUs are not handled.
*   **No Project-Level Information:** The export focuses on individual POUs defined in the editor. It doesn't include project-level configurations, task assignments, or global variable lists that might be part of a full PLCopen XML project file.

The XML export feature provides a basic level of interoperability, primarily for sharing the interface definitions of Function Blocks. Significant improvements would be needed, particularly in representing the implementation logic, for full compatibility with standard PLC engineering tools.
